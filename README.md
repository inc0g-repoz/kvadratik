**kvadratik**

# What's this?
kvadratik is a custom 2D game engine, which only uses [java.awt] to render the in-game objects.
Players are able to connect to your server, that provides a direct link for downloading all necessary assets for joining it.

The worst possible custom dynamically typed script engine enables writing JIT compiled scripts for servers and clients, wrapping and managing the very same entities, that the running game (or server) instance does. Currently, at an early stage of development.

# Say, I wanna build this thing?
Simply run Maven with goals `clean package` for the root project.

# Nice assets you got, dude!
I don't own any of the sprites used in this project. They are all placeholders I took from [here][sprites-resource].
